      "question": "What does the expression P(C|X) represent in the Naive Bayes classifier?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The probability of observing the words X in any document",
        "b": "The probability of class C occurring in the dataset",
        "c": "The probability that the review X belongs to class C",
        "d": "The exact count of words in class C"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This describes P(X), which is not the classifier's goal.",
        "b": "This refers to the prior probability P(C), not P(C|X).",
        "c": "Correct! It is the posterior probability of class C given the review X.",
        "d": "Naive Bayes uses probability, not word count alone."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best explains why Naive Bayes multiplies the probabilities of individual words?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because each word increases the dataset size",
        "b": "Because of the conditional independence assumption",
        "c": "Because it improves vocabulary coverage",
        "d": "Because multiplying probabilities improves accuracy automatically"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Dataset size is unrelated to probability calculation.",
        "b": "Correct! Naive Bayes assumes words are independent given the class, enabling multiplication.",
        "c": "Vocabulary coverage is unrelated to multiplication.",
        "d": "Multiplication is mathematically required, not for automatic accuracy."

      "question": "What problem does Laplace smoothing specifically solve in Naive Bayes?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Preventing underflow when multiplying many probabilities",
        "b": "Assigning a non-zero probability to words not seen in the training data",

        "d": "Reducing the total number of features"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Using log probabilities solves underflow, not Laplace smoothing.",
        "b": "Correct! Laplace smoothing prevents zero probability for unseen words.",
        "c": "Class balancing is unrelated to smoothing.",

    {
      "question": "Why are log probabilities used instead of direct multiplication in Naive Bayes?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To simplify the model by removing all probabilities",
        "b": "To convert classification into a clustering problem",
        "c": "To avoid extremely small values that occur during probability multiplication",
        "d": "To increase the overall classification speed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Log does not remove probabilities.",
        "b": "Classification and clustering are unrelated processes.",
        "c": "Correct! Log transformation prevents numerical underflow from small probabilities.",
        "d": "Speed improvement is not the primary purpose."

        "a": "Removing stopwords to reduce noisy, non-informative words",

        "d": "Increasing the number of capital letters"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Removing stopwords improves signal-to-noise ratio.",
        "b": "Sorting words changes meaning and has no value.",
        "c": "Emoji substitution is not standard preprocessing.",
        "d": "Capitalization does not impact classification."

      "question": "If the model predicts a negative review correctly, which term describes this outcome?",

        "a": "True Positive",
        "b": "True Negative",
        "c": "False Positive",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "True Positive refers to correctly predicting a positive review.",
