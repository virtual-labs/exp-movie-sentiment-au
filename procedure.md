### Procedure
<h5>Step 1: Upload the Dataset</h5>
<p>Start by uploading the movie reviews dataset with sentiment labels. This dataset will be used for training and testing the Naive Bayes classifier.</p>

<h5>Step 2: Data Preprocessing</h5>
<p>Prepare the text data by applying preprocessing steps like removing stopwords, converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, and tokenization.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button to iterate through each data cleaning step.</p>

<h5>Step 3: Feature Engineering</h5>
<p>In this step, the preprocessed text is converted into numerical features for model training. Key techniques include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Splitting text into individual words or tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Word Frequencies:</strong> Counting occurrences of each word in the dataset.</li>

  <li><strong>Bag of Words (BoW):</strong> Representing text as a vector of word counts, ignoring grammar and word order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the <strong>Proceed</strong> button to move forward to the next step.</p>

<h5>Step 4: Data Splitting</h5>
<p>Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. A good split ensures the model learns effectively and generalizes well to new data.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Training Set:</strong> Used to train the Naive Bayes classifier.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing Set:</strong> Used to assess model accuracy on unseen data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the split ratio and observe whether it's a <strong>good split</strong> or a <strong>bad split</strong> based on the description.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Proceed</strong> button to move forward to the next step.</p>

<h5>Step 5: Training the Model</h5>
<p>Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the prepared training dataset. The model learns patterns from the features extracted in the previous steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Probability Calculation:</strong> The classifier computes the probability of a review being positive or negative based on word occurrences.</li>
  <li><strong>Bayes' Theorem:</strong> It applies Bayesâ€™ Theorem to update probabilities as new data is introduced.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click the <strong>Start Training</strong> button to train the model.</p>
<p>Observe the probability and likelihood calculations happening in real time as the Naive Bayes classifier learns from the data.</p>

<p>Enter a movie review and click the <strong>Detect</strong> button.</p>  
<p>Observe the posterior probability calculations in real time, along with the prediction graph and final sentiment classification result.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Evaluation</strong> button to move forward with the process.</p>
<h5>Step 6: Model Evaluation</h5>
<p>Evaluate the performance of the trained Naive Bayes classifier using key metrics.</p>  
<ul>  
  <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Measures the percentage of correctly classified reviews.</li>  
  <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Indicates how many of the predicted positive reviews are actually positive.</li>  
  <li><strong>Recall:</strong> Measures how well the model identifies all actual positive reviews.</li>  
  <li><strong>F1-Score:</strong> A balance between precision and recall for overall model performance.</li>  
</ul>
