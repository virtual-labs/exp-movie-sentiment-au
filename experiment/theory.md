<h2>Understanding Naive Bayes for Sentiment Analysis</h2>

<h5>1. Introduction</h5>
<p>Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether a given piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It is widely applied in various domains such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research.</p>

<h5>2. Importance of Sentiment Analysis</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Enables businesses to understand customer emotions and opinions.</li>
  <li>Automates the analysis of large volumes of text data.</li>
  <li>Improves decision-making by identifying trends and customer satisfaction levels.</li>
  <li>Used in recommendation systems, brand monitoring, and product reviews.</li>
</ul>

<h5>3. What is Naive Bayes?</h5>
<p>Naive Bayes is a supervised learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem. It is particularly effective for text classification tasks like spam detection and sentiment analysis.</p>

<h5>3.1 Bayes' Theorem</h5>
<p>Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of related conditions.</p>
<p><b>Formula:</b></p>
<p>P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>P(A|B)</b> → Probability of class A given feature B (posterior probability).</li>
  <li><b>P(B|A)</b> → Probability of feature B occurring given class A (likelihood).</li>
  <li><b>P(A)</b> → Prior probability of class A.</li>
  <li><b>P(B)</b> → Probability of feature B occurring.</li>
</ul>

<h5>3.2 Why is it Called "Naive"?</h5>
<p>The algorithm assumes that all features (words in a review) are independent of each other, which is rarely true in real-world scenarios. Despite this "naive" assumption, it performs well for text classification tasks.</p>

<h5>4. Steps in Sentiment Analysis Using Naive Bayes</h5>

<h5>Step 1: Obtain a Dataset</h5>
<p>A dataset containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative is collected. This dataset helps the model learn patterns in text and classify future reviews.</p>

<h5>Step 2: Preprocess the Data</h5>
<p>Text preprocessing is a crucial step in sentiment analysis to remove noise and improve model accuracy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Convert text to lowercase:</b> Ensures uniformity and prevents case sensitivity issues.</li>
  <li><b>Remove punctuation and special characters:</b> Unnecessary symbols are removed to simplify text processing.</li>
  <li><b>Remove stopwords:</b> Common words (e.g., "the", "is", "in") that do not contribute to sentiment are filtered out.</li>
  <li><b>Tokenization:</b> Splits text into individual words (tokens) for analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 3: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets</h5>
<p>The dataset is divided into:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Training set:</b> Used to train the model by learning patterns in the data.</li>
  <li><b>Testing set:</b> Used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 4: Train the Naive Bayes Model</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Calculate word probabilities:</b> The algorithm calculates the probability of words appearing in positive and negative reviews.</li>
  <li><b>Apply Bayes' Theorem:</b> The probability of a new review being positive or negative is computed based on word occurrences.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 5: Classify New Reviews</h5>
<p>When a new movie review is provided, the model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Breaks it into individual words.</li>
  <li>Calculates the probability of the review being positive or negative.</li>
  <li>Assigns the sentiment label with the highest probability.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 6: Evaluate Model Performance</h5>
<p>To assess how well the model performs, several metrics are used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Accuracy:</b> Measures the percentage of correctly classified reviews.</li>
  <li><b>Precision:</b> Measures how many predicted positive reviews are actually positive.</li>
  <li><b>Recall:</b> Measures how many actual positive reviews were correctly classified.</li>
  <li><b>F1-score:</b> A balance between precision and recall.</li>
</ul>

<h5>5. Advantages of Naive Bayes in Sentiment Analysis</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Fast and efficient for text classification.</li>
  <li>Performs well even with limited training data.</li>
  <li>Handles large datasets effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h5>6. Limitations of Naive Bayes</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Assumes independence between features, which may not hold in real-world text.</li>
  <li>Struggles with complex language structures and sarcasm.</li>
</ul>

<h5>7. Key Takeaways</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Naive Bayes is a simple yet effective classification algorithm for sentiment analysis.</li>
  <li>Preprocessing text is essential for improving model performance.</li>
  <li>Model evaluation helps determine how well the classifier generalizes to new data.</li>
</ul>
