    {
      "question": "Why is it important to split data into training and testing sets?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To make the dataset smaller",
        "b": "To evaluate how well the model performs on new data",
        "c": "To ensure the model memorizes all training data",
        "d": "To increase the dataset size"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Splitting the dataset is not for reducing size.",
        "b": "Correct! A test set helps check how well the model generalizes to unseen data.",
        "c": "A good model should generalize, not memorize.",
        "d": "Splitting does not increase the dataset size."
