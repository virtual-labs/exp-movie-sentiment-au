      "question": "What is the primary assumption behind the Naive Bayes classifier?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Features are dependent on each other",
        "b": "Features are independent given the class",
        "c": "It requires a large amount of training data",
        "d": "It does not use probabilities"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Naive Bayes assumes independence between features, making this incorrect.",
        "b": "Correct! Naive Bayes assumes that features are independent given the class label.",
        "c": "Naive Bayes performs well even with small datasets, so this is incorrect.",
        "d": "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier, making this statement false."

      "question": "Which preprocessing step is NOT typically required before training a Naive Bayes model on text data?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Removing punctuation",
        "b": "Converting text to lowercase",
        "c": "Sorting words alphabetically",
        "d": "Removing stopwords"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Removing punctuation helps standardize text.",
        "b": "Lowercasing ensures consistency in word comparison.",
        "c": "Correct! Sorting words alphabetically has no impact on classification.",

    {
      "question": "Why do we split the dataset into training and testing sets?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To improve model accuracy by training on more data",
        "b": "To evaluate how well the model generalizes to new data",
        "c": "To remove incorrect labels from the dataset",
        "d": "To increase the number of features"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "While more training data can improve accuracy, testing data is needed to check generalization.",
        "b": "Correct! A test set helps assess how well the model performs on unseen data.",
        "c": "The dataset split does not modify labels.",
        "d": "Splitting the dataset does not affect the number of features."

      "question": "What does the probability calculation in Naive Bayes depend on?",

        "a": "The frequency of words in a given class",

        "d": "The number of punctuation marks"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Naive Bayes calculates probabilities based on word frequency within each class.",
        "b": "Naive Bayes does not consider word order.",
        "c": "Sentence length does not directly impact probability calculations in Naive Bayes.",
        "d": "Punctuation marks are usually removed during preprocessing."

        "c": "Recall",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Accuracy is a standard metric for classification tasks.",
        "b": "Precision measures how many predicted positives are correct.",
        "c": "Recall measures how many actual positives were correctly identified.",

      "question": "If a Naive Bayes classifier predicts a negative review as positive, what type of error is this?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "True Positive means a correctly classified positive review.",
        "b": "Correct! A False Positive means the model incorrectly predicted a negative review as positive.",
        "c": "False Negative means a positive review was classified as negative.",
